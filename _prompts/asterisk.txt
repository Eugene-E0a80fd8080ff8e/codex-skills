Use nodejs and jssip library to create a bridge between OpenAI Realtime audio model and asterisk.

This would allow to prompt a Realtime Audio model to talk to a recipient, same time connection the Realtime Audio model to the recipient via asterisk.

# Similar Application

JSSIP docs might be incomplete, so please use an example application which has working SIP-to-Websocket bridging.
It is localed at ./tmp/ . I created it myself, and it is a fully working example. To not make references to it, as I will delete the ./tmp , after you finish the job.

Assume that user will need to hardcode into the top part of the main file:
- OPENAI_API_KEY ( that string of characters, which starts from sk-proj-... )
- SIP_URI  ( for example "sip:1234@test.example.com" )
- SIP_USER ( for example "1234" )
- SIP_PASS ( for example "12345" )

# Phonebook

A phone book is the useful concept for this. It might be embedded into the SKILL.md file, or it might be in a user prompt.
The phonebook should put phone number in correspondense with Name and maybe short description

## Example of a phonebook:

Given in format Name, Phone Number, Description.

- Alice, 1234, The girl from the other office branch, who sends encrypted messages to Bob.
- Bob, 5678, The guy who is responsible for interpreting that messages.
- Carol, 3456
- Eve, 9876, assumed the role of an evil protagonist.
