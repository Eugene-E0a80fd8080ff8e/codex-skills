use javascript to create a voice dialogue agent which would be a skill for the codex tool.
  https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/
Use npm packages mic and speaker.

Connect mic and speaker to OpenAI Realtime audio model for a dialog.

Upon start , the tool should receive the detailed prompt which should:
- give the agent the info needed for dialog.
- state, what needs to be learned from the user.

Note that during the dialog , the Realtime audio model would not have the access to most of the info which is accessible by underlying agent (Codex).


Assume that user will need to hardcode needed keys into the source code: OPENAI_API_KEY
Instruct the user in the installation manual.
